# ψ
ψ, is powerful quantum computational toolkit based on the idea of simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers.

## Project Prospects
- `libpsi`: A dependency free library featuring an enviroment to write and design quantum circuits, used by all sub-projects in ψ. Fitted with a series of bindings to allow use in different languages.
- `qasmc`: An [OpenQASM](https://openqasm.com/) compiler allowing you to write quantum programs and have them be complied to native executables ran on classical computers using an [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) backend.
- `psi-gui`: An application allowing you to design quantum circuits graphically instead of programatically. Using both `libpsi` and `qasmc`, you are capable of designing your own quantum gates by the use of an [OpenQASM]([https://openqasm.com/](https://openqasm.com/)) gate descriptor. 

## Disclaimer
This project is a large and ongoing effort, and I try my hardest to deliver the advertised feature, some may not arrive as planned or according to any scheduled timeline. The development process is subject to change based on technical challenges, research priorities and the simultaneous management of multiple on-going projects, spanning both computer science, physics and unrelated domains.
