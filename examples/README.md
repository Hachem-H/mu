# Examples
In this directory, you will find a series of directories providing examples on how to use all the $\psi$ libraries. Since this entire project is based on workspaces, all you have to do use the following command:
```sh
$ cargo run -p [example name]
```

For instance:
```sh
$ cargo run -p simple_gates
$ cargo run -p visualizers
...
```
